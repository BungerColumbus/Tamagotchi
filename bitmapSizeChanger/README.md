## Purpose

To transform images into text such that i don't have to write them manually.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

There is a main class which runs the Jframe
A frame class which is... well the Jframe you dum dum
A panel class which is where everything runs and makes the magic happen. I am too lazy to explain it all. Read through it as it is pretty intuitive. It's java, not assembly.
